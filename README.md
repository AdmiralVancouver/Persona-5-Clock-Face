# Lessons learned / Final thoughts

This was built for personal use as there did not exist any other Persona themed watches in the Fitbit store. I was able to brush up on some JavaScript, CSS, SVG, and HTML coding. However, coding for Fitbit devices is a bit different as many of the standard JS and CSS features are missing, such as flex-box. Thus, I had to find work arounds to achieve the desired result. Overall, a quick and easy learning experience.
