**#NOTE:**
I built on this further and tweaked the icons as well as how each metric worked. It's not a huge change but I had originally wanted to just have a clock-face for my fitbit that I liked. I saw this clock face and it was really close to what I wanted with just a few things I'd like to change so I went ahead and did so. Credit goes to the original author
and can be found at https://github.com/kmnthecoder who still maintains the original clock-face. 

Original readme from original author is below:

# Lessons learned / Final thoughts

This was built for personal use as there did not exist any other Persona themed watches in the Fitbit store. I was able to brush up on some JavaScript, CSS, SVG, and HTML coding. However, coding for Fitbit devices is a bit different as many of the standard JS and CSS features are missing, such as flex-box. Thus, I had to find work arounds to achieve the desired result.
